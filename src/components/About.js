        This app compiles the Murders and Crimes reported in Beaumont, Tx in
        2019 from articles and police reports. It then charts them on two
        separate maps. There is also a search map function provided as well. The
        resources page provides additional maps and data pertaining to crime
        around the country. The Beaumont Police reports website is also on the
        resource page as well. Note, this is not a definitive list and is
        subject to change over time.
